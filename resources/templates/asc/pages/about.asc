Thanks for visiting my blog! My name is Micah Elliott, and I live in Portland,
Oregon, USA. I'm an entrepreneur and founder of http://membean.com[Membean]: an
online vocabulary training program used by schools in all 50 states and around
the globe. I spend much of my time there coding and managing infrastructure.
You should sign up for http://membean.com/products/Personal/plans[a free Membean
account]; let me know how it goes!

// I presently manage our infrastructure, train teachers, create podcasts and
// other content, and even do some development.

**My goal for this blog is to share technical knowledge and discoveries in
hopes that we can all continue learning. There is a focus on infrastructure,
Linux, programming, and teaching.**

_(You'll find a some unfinished work on this “blog”. Some sections are a
dumping ground. When something comes to mind I'll sketch it out here in public.
There is no real notion of “publish” -- that becomes too formal and I end up
sitting on things. So I write, save, and push frequently. Sorry.)_

Beyond Membean, my interests include programming in
http://clojure.org/[Clojure], learning about statistics (mostly with
http://www.r-project.org/[R]), triathlons and marathons, and bookkeeping at
my kids’ baseball games.

This blog
http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/education/grammar/comprise-versus-compose[comprises]
a mix of my favorite tech (which I also like to write about). It’s hosted on
https://www.freebsd.org/[FreeBSD] 10.1 by a
https://www.digitalocean.com/[DigitalOcean] droplet running
http://nginx.org/[Nginx], and is
deployed via http://www.ansible.com/[Ansible]. The blog engine is
http://cryogenweb.org/docs/deploying-with-nginx-VPS.html[Cryogen], written in
Clojure, and it is nice to look at because it mostly came that way (including
http://getbootstrap.com/[Bootstrap]). Posts are written in
http://asciidoc.org/[Asciidoc] with http://www.vim.org/[Vim].
Changes are managed and shared on https://github.com/MicahElliott/blog[Github].
Read my link:/posts/2015-07-02-cryogen-on-freebsd-with-ansible.html[recipe]
on how to set it up if you want one, too.

Videos here are captured with

https://kdenlive.org/[Kdenlive]. Audio is recorded and edited with
http://web.audacityteam.org/[Audacity]. You may have noticed that everything I
use is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source[Open Source]. I spend nearly
all my working time on an https://www.archlinux.org/[Arch Linux] system.
