I’m not actively seeking work presently, but I’m always **open to hearing about
opportunities**. Unfortunately, I’ve found ways to really spoil myself with
tools and languages that I love, and have become pretty particular about the
tech I’ll work with.

**I’m no longer interested in working directly with most mainstream languages**,
like Python or Ruby (and of course Perl or Java). If you want any of those to be
a major part of the work, expect to pay more. Life is too short to work in
unsatisfying environments. I also don’t do anything specific to Mac or Windows
(but I won’t complain openly if others around me do). In fact, most things not
open source are probably non-starters.

**What I do love to work with are Lisps.** I’ve had great experiences and
productivity with **Clojure**. And I’m liking **Racket** even more these days
for it’s light-weightedness and teachability. If I’m scripting, I’ll get it done
with **Zsh** until I need some sophisticated data structures or more serious
design work. Then I’ll gladly progress to Clojure/Racket. I’m open to developing
on **Node**, but it would need to be with **ClojureScript** or even
**Livescript** (if the PHBs don’t recognize that, call it CoffeeScript), but
not straight JS.

I like things to be deployed with **Ansible**. I’m not very interested in spending
time with Puppet or Chef. If I’m designing your infrastructure, it will probably
be running the latest **CentOS**.

I really enjoy developing on **Arch Linux**, but I’m also open to Fedora and
PC-BSD. I like other Linuxes, (Gen)too. I’d be happy to help your whole office
get set up on Linux.

I can help you scale your cloud, or even get you out of the cloud onto bare
metal and into great data centers. I’ll help you automate and monitor just about
anything, whether with a bunch of glue or new complex systems. And of course it
will be secure!

Although development and sysadmin are my true joys, I also travel, present to
customers at their work/webinars/conferences, design marketing material, create
screencasts, write blog posts, work crazy hours when needed, and play well with
others. I can work remotely (on whatever schedule), or ride my bike downtown
(Portland, OR) every day. Put me with great people and I’ll stick around for
years.

If you’ve made it this far, Wow, great!
