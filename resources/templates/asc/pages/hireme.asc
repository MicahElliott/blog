I’m always **open to hearing about work opportunities**. Unfortunately, I’ve
found ways to really spoil myself with tools and languages that I love, and have
become pretty particular about the tech I’ll work with. However, if your
projects are exceptionally interesting, get in touch, even if you don’t meet
all the criteria below.

**I’m no longer interested in working directly with most mainstream languages**,
like Python or Ruby (and of course Perl or Java). If you want any of those to be
a major part of the work, then I’m working for money more than for happiness, so
expect to pay more. Life is too short to work suboptimally in unsatisfying
environments. And, I’ll much prefer to work with you if much of your stack is open
source.

**What I do love to work with are Lisps.** I’ve had great experiences
and productivity with **Clojure**. And I’m liking **Racket** even more
these days for its light-weightedness and teachability. If I’m
scripting, I’ll get it done with **Zsh** until I need some
sophisticated data structures or more serious design work. Then I’ll
gladly progress to Clojure/Racket. I’m open to developing on **Node**,
but it would need to be with **ClojureScript** or even **Livescript**
(if the PHBs don’t recognize that, call it CoffeeScript), but not
straight JS.

has good ideas, too, but you’d have to give me a little time to pick
it up. I have some experience with **OCaml** and **Haskell**, and
happy to take them on, too.

I like things to be deployed with **Ansible**. I’m not _too_ interested in
spending time with Puppet or Chef, but not opposed. If I’m designing
your infrastructure, it will probably be running the latest **CentOS** (systemd,
firewalld, and other new goodness).

I really enjoy developing on **Arch Linux** (in Emacs), but I’m also
open to Fedora and PC-BSD (which I also run on servers and at home). I
like other Linuxes, (Gen)too. I’d be happy to help your whole office
get set up and productive on Linux.

I can help you scale your cloud, or even get you out of the cloud onto
bare metal and into great data centers. I’ll help you **automate** and
**monitor** just about anything, whether with a bunch of glue or new,
complex (but well-documented) systems. And of course it will be
secure!

Although **development** and **sysadmin** are my true joys, I also travel,
present to customers at their work/webinars/conferences, design marketing
material, create screencasts, write blog posts, design offices (with real-time
status monitors!), work crazy hours when needed, and play well with others. I
can work remotely (on whatever schedule), or ride my bike downtown (Portland,
OR) every day. Put me with great people and I’ll stick around for years.

If you’ve made it this far, Wow, great!
