Hi! I’ll be out in NYC next week (Wed-Fri), so thought I’d stop by if you’re interested in chatting about potential employment. I live in Portland, OR, and I’m not ready to move to NY, but available to work remotely. And I don’t mind making trips to NYC (or elsewhere) when needed.

I’m going to be job shopping over the next couple months and Jane Street caught my interest for its focus on functional programming. I’m a founder of my present company, and things have stabilized enough that I can soon transition onto a more satisfying development-focused path.
