I’m trying an experiment where I’ve turned my keyboard repeat rate way down.
This should force me to never hold down a key for repetition, but rather use a
prefix like `4w` (vim) or `Ctrl-Backspace` (browsers). I’m learning some
interesting things!

This is done easily across X with:

    #              msdelay rate
    #exec xset r rate 250    60    # super fast keyboard cursor delay and rate!
    exec xset r rate 250    2     # super slow (vim training)

That line is from my `~/.i3/config`. Remove the `exec` to put in in `~/.xinitrc`
or the CLI.
