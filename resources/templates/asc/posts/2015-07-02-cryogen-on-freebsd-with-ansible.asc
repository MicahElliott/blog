The tech running this blog is described on the link:/about.html[About page]. This
recipes explains what I did to set it all up.

== Infrastructure
You can set up a static site easily enough with Github pages, but I think it’s
nice to manage a server yourself. You might want it for other things, and you
get to control it completely. Your learnings there will apply to any other
site/server you host.

You can get yourself a “Droplet” at http://digitalocean.com[DigitalOcean] for $5
USD per month. That’s cheap. It’s just a matter of a few clicks on their simple
control panel. I’m somewhat near San Francisco, so I chose that data center.
link:/posts/2015-07-17-why-centos.html[I like CentOS] quite a bit as a server
OS, but I also like to play around with FreeBSD, so I chose that. It’s a recent
addition to the DO arsenal, and is a rock-solid OS with a fantastic security
record and a very famous file system: ZFS.

== Deployment
I’ve configured Ansible to push changes to the Droplet. Take a look at
https://github.com/MicahElliott/blog/blob/master/provn/site.yaml[the simple playbook].
I’d normally have set this up
https://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_roles.html[hierarchically with roles],
but this machine’s config is simple enough to fit in a single file.

Any time I feel like deploying, I can simple run `deploy.zsh` to fire the
`ansible-playbook` command.

== Git Versioning
I like to commit often, but I don’t rely on git for updating the blog. I do
maintain the engine, styling, and text all in
https://github.com/MicahElliott/blog[a single repository]. I usually commit when
a new post is added, and more frequently as it nears completion. Probably a good
idea to have a deploy cadence that’s in line with git-commits.

== Cryogen
Although I’ve looked at Jekyll, Octopress, and several others over the years,
Cryogen is looking like a winner for a few reasons.

- minimal code base
- one of the developers is the most prolific author of clojure web dev
- they’re very responsive to issues
- it’s already got bootstrap, and is thus mobile-friendly
- no engine to run on the server; just deploy the static `public/` directory
- it supports
  link:/posts/2015-07-02-stop-using-markdown.html[Asciidoc, which is superior to Markdown]
- it comes with a base theme that is easy to style; just tweak the existing
  HTML template files that are in your project.
- Google Fonts are included. I really like
  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/whatfont/jabopobgcpjmedljpbcaablpmlmfcogm?hl=en[WhatFont
  for Chrome] for showing fonts. Try it here to see what I’ve chosen.

The documentation is small and great, and you can start running your blog
locally by following
http://cryogenweb.org/docs/getting-started.html[this tiny guide].

== Things you can add
Add feedburner as the RSS feed. This takes load off your server as you start
getting subscribers who may hit your feed frequently/automatically. You just
need to edit your `base.html` to replace the feed link to point to your
feedburner XML.

Google Analytics is a simple way to see your site traffic. It’s a simple matter
of pasting a tiny javascript snippet in the bottom of your `base.html`.

Videos can be embedded. You could use Youtube, but Vimeo might be better at not
pointing to random, odd videos as recommendations.

== Things that are not needed
- tag clouds
- ads
- wysiwyg editing
- user management
- a comment system (spam is insidious), but Disqus is an option
- backups (they’re already in git)
- blogrolls
- emailer
- categories
- widgets for “like”ing or twitter updates

Although I use CloudFlare elsewhere to protect from DDoS attacks (been hit
before) I don’t see much need for it for a blog. It could be added.
