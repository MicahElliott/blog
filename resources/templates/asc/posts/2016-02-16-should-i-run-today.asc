_Probably..._

It is not downpouring.

I have (semi-)waterproof shoes.

My running gear is nearby.

My phone is charged and GPS is working.

Nothing is hurting too badly.

I am not sick, injured, or hung over.

It is not too late or too early.

Those are a lot of things that have worked out today. Better get out there.


_If I don't..._

I will lose progress.

My stats will suffer.

I will gain weight.

I will not feel great.

The next event will hurt even worse.

I won't get to listen to a podcast.
