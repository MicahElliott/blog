“Networking is an essential part of building wealth.”  __— Armstrong Williams__

The networking toolchain is a bit different on every OS. I’ve been spending
enough time on CentOS 7 lately that its specifics are worth recording.

I’ll assume you don’t care about OSs that deviate much from RH-derived. I’m also
leaving out anything to do with IPv6.

Wireless networking is not something you do much on servers, so it (`iw`) is
mostly omitted, too.

== Packages
iproute2

== Commands

The `ip` command has replaced some of the trusty old guard. If you use Zsh, the
`ip` tab-completion is excellent for quickly using various subcommands.

    wolfram cidr

    ethtool

    ip a

    ip link

    ifconfig

    ifstat

    ifup/ifdown

    nmcli/nmtui

    nmcli d s

    NetworkManager (need it for firewalld)

    sys

    netstat -tulpn
    netstat -pn tcp
    netstat -ln4
    netstat -naf inet

    ss (socket stat)

    netcat

    arp

    route

    iotop

    iostat

    iperf3

    host

    whois/dig

    ping

    lsof -ni

    tcpdump

    ipcalc

    ifrename

    sockstack -4

Although `traceroute` is the old standard, the netadmins I’ve worked with tend
to ask for `mtr` output.

    mtr/tracepath

    firewall-cmd

    iostat -xdm 5

== Files

    /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-e*
    /etc/services
    /etc/resolv.conf

== Normal Things
pinging local Gb network: 0.15 ms
