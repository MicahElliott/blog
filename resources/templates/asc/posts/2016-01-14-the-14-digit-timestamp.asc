**Audience:** _anyone_

The so-called “14-digit timestamp” is turning up in more and more places. For
those unfamiliar, it takes the form of:

    YYYYMMDDhhmmss

I’ve seen it recently in https://github.com/yogthos/migratus[Migratus] and
Rails/Cap deploys (`current` symlink), and it’s been used widely by MySQL.
They’re pretty handy for setting to-the-second precision for ordering of things,
like database migrations. And, they’re fairly human-parsable.

At the time of this writing, the 14-digit time is `20160114180301`. If you find
that hard to eye-parse, here’s a (really ugly) shell function to help:

    dt14p() { sed -r 's/([0-9]{4})([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2})/\1-\2-\3 \4:\5:\6/' <<< $1 }

    % dt14p 20160114184117
    2016-01-14 18:41:17

This enables `date` (and your eyes) to parse it.

Something I see missed on occasion is the use of UTC on such stamps. That seems
pretty important if you’re using these for ordering, and have a time
zone-distributed team.

14s are not to be confused with the 10-digit epoch-second-stamp, or
https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/reference/bson-types/#document-bson-type-date[MongoDB’s]
similar 64-bit 13-digit stamp (1452758412345).

You might also find https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_week_date[weekstamps]
useful for writing weekly reports and other organization.

== Generating a 14-digit stamp


    date --utc +%Y%m%d%H%M%S

Why not make it an alias?

    alias dt14='date --utc +%Y%m%d%H%M%S'

And use it often:

    mkdir `dt14`-something

_(I usually find the 8-digit datestamp `dt8` to be sufficient for directory
names.)_

While we’re at it, here are some other useful stamping aliases. I use the `dt`
prefix to make them easy to both remember and tab-complete. Some of these I use
every day. Put them in your link:/posts/2016-01-16-how-to-structure-zshrc.html[.zshrc]
and enjoy!

not on Linux.)_
