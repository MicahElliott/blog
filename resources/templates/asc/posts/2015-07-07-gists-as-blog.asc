Github's Gist is almost good enough as a blog. If you don't want to take the
time to set up your own blog, you could probably get away with using gists. As
an example, https://gist.github.com/MicahElliott[this] is a pretty decent index
display.

== Where it shines
- nice comment system (https://gist.github.com/MicahElliott/3048622[example])
- markdown support
- auto-abstracts (shortened posts in index)
- built-in editor or use git
- store associated files with your article in a real git repo
- nothing to host yourself

== Where it falls short

- no global feed
- people don't expect it to serve as your blog
- gets cluttered with other snippets
- google will not index these well
- no analytics
- it seems unlikely that someone will like your post and decide to go explore your other gists

== Conclusion
Gists are great. Even if you set up a real blog, you'll still want to use gists to host code samples.
