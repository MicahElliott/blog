Three great operating systems are recommended for growing your programming
chops: Arch Linux, Gentoo Linux, and FreeBSD/PC-BSD. You're welcome to go with
a more mainstream UNIX like Ubuntu or OSX, but these have a tendency to hide
lower level OS details; you'll learn a lot more by choosing one of our
recommendations. Your preference for control, speed, licensing, and
mainstreamedness will determine your choice. All three are bleeding edge
rolling release, highly open, fast, minimalist, configurable via text files,
and security conscious. And all have uniquely fantastic package managers.

== Linux or BSD?

.A wise person on some podcast I once heard said something like ...
____
Linux is a PC OS ported to UNIX, BSD is a UNIX ported to the PC.

The first consideration is what license model appeals to you. Linux is
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License[GPL] (v2), which
means that many of the tools you'll use are going to be GPL, and changes that
you make to code should be shared back with the community. BSD's stance on
licensing is that you can do whatever you want with changing of code. For some
business cases this may be a preferable model. You may not be augmenting your
system tools or kernel, but some day you very well may.

Linux is more popular than BSD, but that doesn't mean it's better. BSD powers
much of the internet today, including sites like Netflix and Yahoo. It's even
what's underneath OSX.

Linux has broader reach, particularly in mobile and embedded computing. It's
what powers your Android phone. It's in your router, and probably even in your
microwave. There are literally
http://distrowatch.com/[hundreds of distributions] out there that you could
install on your laptop right now, many of which are in widespread use in data
centers and as desktops.

When you start up your shiny new service on an affordable VPS, most of your
options are going to be Linux based. Popular VPS hosting services include
Linode, DigitalOcean, and Rackspace, all of which primarily offer Linux (and
only Linux). There are BSD hosts out there, but the paucity is something to
keep in mind. If you have some idea of what OS you'll want to eventually host
your apps on, you probably want to choose that OS as what you'll run for your
home/development systems. IOW, if you decide to go with a Mac (or PC-BSD) for
your daily development, you may want to go with FreeBSD in the cloud.
Otherwise, choose a Linux family for both.

Linuxes nowadays are mostly based on systemd. This gives you sophisticated
control of running services, fancy journaling/logging, and super-fast booting.
BSDs have a simpler init startup system (but sometimes simple is a feature).

http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/10-things/10-differences-between-linux-and-bsd/[this TechRepublic post].

== Arch Linux
The first Linux option is Arch. It is the most popular of our three and
features several niceties:

* Fast installation
* Wikis and forums for any topic under the sun
* Binary packages for speed of install
* A lot of adoption momentum

== Gentoo Linux
Gentoo is a DIY OS. You build everything yourself to suit the architectural
details of your system; you even configure and build your own kernel! It takes
some time to build/install a Gentoo, but the result and learning experience is
usually worth it. Compelling features:

* System is tuned to be fast!
* Ultimate control of every tool
* Portage/emerge

== Fedora Linux
The main advantage to using fedora is that it's in the RedHat family. The most
commonly deployed server OS these days is CentOS (also based on RedHat). Read
link:posts/2015-07-17-why-centos.html[why I like CentOS] to see why I this is a
good choice.

== PC-BSD

FreeBSD is by far the most popular of the BSDs. The experience is pretty
similar to Gentoo, in that you can build most things yourself. It has some
very compelling features:

* ZFS (compression, reliability, raid, speed, ease of use)
* Disk encryption
* DTrace
* All-in-one OS, maintaining the kernel and userland together
* Reputation for robust security
* A PC-BSD super-distro with easy installation, making laptop and server
  consistent

Great, you can make a choice now! It won't be final, but it will get you on
your way with your first machine of many in your lucrative career.
