_Probably..._

It's not downpouring or freezing or broiling.

My phone is charged and GPS is toiling.

My gear is nearby.

Runner's high makes me feel I can fly.

I'm not sick, injured, hung over, or feeling too sadly.

Nothing is hurting too badly.

I have (semi-)waterproof shoes.

I really have nothing to lose.

It's not  too early or too late.

Better get out there.  Don't test fate.


_If I don't..._

I will lose progress.

My stats will be a mess.

I will gain weight.

I won't feel great.

The next event will hurt even worse.

I might have to see a nurse.

I won't get to hear a podcast.

Run those miles as if they're my last!
