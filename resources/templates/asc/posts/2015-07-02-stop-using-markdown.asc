**UPDATE 2017**: I'm going to move everything to org-mode or Markdown since
  I'm no longer finding the case for adoc compelling enough.

Markdown has become the de facto standard for plain text syntax. It's supported
in the webform editors of Stack Overflow, Github, and many blogs, wikis, and
forums. It’s built into most static site generators. You can even use it to
write a book. It's fantastic that it has raised awareness of text-based markup,
but it’s not enough.

Asciidoc fills in many of the shortcomings of Markdown. Here's a
http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc[cheat-sheet] to give you a feel for its
syntax. It's almost as simple as Markdown, and thus quick to learn.

== Markdown Shortcomings
You’re probably aware of most of these, but maybe don’t notice the pain as much
as you should.

Comments are clumsy. And multi-line becomes a mess.

Vim ends up loading its HTML syntax which clutters functionality and causes confusion.

No good way to add extra markup without dropping into HTML.

No tables, citations, footnotes, or sub-/super-scripting.

Inferior to Asciidoc's Docbook toolchain.

== Asciidoc Extras and General Niceties
Consistency of section delimiters. All are four characters and delineate blocks:
line-wise pairs of quadruples `-` (code), `_` (quote), `/` (comment), `=`
(caption), `+` (pass-through HTML).

Titles can be added to most sections.

Auto-up-converting of some punctuation, like the pedant's apostrophes -- and yes, even dashes.

You can add anchors.

Auto-generated Table Of Contents.

== Markdown-to-Asciidoc Conversion Guide

=== Headings
Markdown:
----
## Foo
----
Asciidoc:
----
== Foo
----

=== Links
Markdown:
----
[This is Google](http://google.com)
----
Asciidoc:
----
http://google.com[This is Google]
link:/relative-page[some relative page]
----

The Asciidoc feels more natural to me. My first instinct when inserting a link
is to insert the link itself. It's also nice to avoid the parens. Also, I often
will type a paragraph that has a few things that need to be linked after the
fact. It's really easy to paste the link just before the text in Asciidoc.

=== Images
Markdown:
----
![Mittens is my fave](/img/kitty1.jpg "My Cat")
----
Asciidoc:
----
image:/img/kitty1.jpg[My Cat]  Mittens is my fave] "My Cat")
----

=== Comments
Markdown:
----
<!-- just a comment -->
----

Asciidoc:
----
// just a comment
----
or multi-line (yay!):
----
////
a bunch
of comment
lines
////
----

=== Code Fragments
Markdown:
----
    This is indented, yet subtle and easily mishandled when mixing with lists.
----

Asciidoc (weird but easy enough):
----
  ----
  This is left-aligned, or wherever you want. It is explicit.
  ----
----

Asciidoc also supports Markdown-style indents, but I'm finding that being
explicit is less susceptible to ambiguous translating.

=== HRs
Markdown:
----
  ----
----

Asciidoc (weird but easy enough):
----
  ''''
----

=== Definition lists

Asciidoc is much richer, and not significantly harder to learn.
