I’ve been hooked on CentOS for servers for a couple years now. We used to use
Ubuntu, but I see several advantages to choosing CentOS over Ubuntu and others.
Here’s why:

**CentOS (and Fedora) have had Systemd in production releases for over a year.**
This is probably the biggest reason. Ubuntu is getting it eventually, but CentOS
has had it and it’s working well. You’ll have to adopt it with Linux anyway, so
why not now?

**CentOS is a first-class member of a strong Red Hat family.** They were
recently acquired by Red Hat and now benefit from lots of company resources.

**Vendors will install CentOS for you.**

**More hardware is certified for Red Hat.**

**CentOS releases are good for 10 years.** If you were totally stuck with not being
able to upgrade a system, this makes for a pretty good life span. Ubuntu LTSs
are _only_ 5 years. :) So, minor win.

**Fedora is a well-tested cutting edge distro and CentOS get the best of its
learnings.** It’s solid as a desktop, so you can use it for development and have
a pretty consistent environment across your desk and servers.

**Red Hat/CentOS have a well-defined focus.** They embrace the fact that they
are a server OS. Compare this to Ubuntu’s focus on touch interfaces, display
managers, phones.

**There are certifications for becoming a (so-called) Red Hat expert.**

**There is an upgrade path to RHEL if someone insists upon it.** Some PHBs will
want to know that they can throw money around to buy “guarantees” about
stability/support.

**CentOS is ubiquitous.** Most cloud VPSs will offer it as an option.

**Docker is in production.** I don’t think Docker is a panacea, but it’s good to
see it’s being well tested in RHEL and CentOS.

**Firewalld is new and in.** It’s not terribly well documented, but it’s really
just a front end to iptables.

**EPEL provides many extra packages.**

== Shortcomings
Not everything is perfect with CentOS, though. It does not always have the
newest versions of packages you might desire. I end up building my own versions
of Nginx, Redis, Ruby, and others.

The security update story is also a bit lacking. The simplest way I have found
to stay up-to-date on vulnerability patching is to watch the daily mail list,
and simply update every server late on Saturday nights. No, it’s not my idea of
a good time.

Yum is the package manager and it is in flux, and essentially

Fortunately, it appears to have some backward compatibility with yum and should
provide a clean transition.
