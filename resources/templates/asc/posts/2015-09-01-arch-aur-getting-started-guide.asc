**Audience:** _intermediate_

There are many options to access Arch’s User Repository (AUR). The AUR is one of
the most compelling features of Arch Linux. I’ll walk you through the simplest
path to getting started with the AUR, with minimal bootstrapping effort.

The most primitive yet useful tool I’ve found for first accessing the AUR is
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/cower/[cower]. On the right side of that page
you’ll see a link to “Download snapshot”. It’s
https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/cower.tar.gz[https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/cower.tar.gz]

Grab/extract/install it with:

    cd $TMPDIR
    wget https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/snapshot/cower.tar.gz
    tar xzvf cower.tar.gz
    cd cower
    makepkg -si

You could continue to search the AUR website for packages to install, and
continue to run `wget/tar/cur/makepkg` on them. But AUR managers make life much
better than that. And now with `cower` (and soon more) you have full
command-line access to the AUR!

Let’s search for a more featureful AUR
manager. `cower` is cool. You can use it directly, and it’s the simple base
command underlying a few of the other managers. It’s also a good tool for
learning about the low-level details of the AUR (now right now). But we’ll
prefer those managers that conform to `pacman`’s option syntax.

    cower -s aurget
    cower -s pacaur
    cower -s yaourt

These also all happen to support nice Zsh completions.

Let’s find and install something useful.
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SB=p&SO=d&O=0&PP=50[Here] is the list of
packages, sorted by popularity. You’ll notice `yaourt` is at the top.
Interesting. Install `archey`

    aurget -S --noconfirm --noedit archey
