**Audience:** _programmers_

Animated GIFs can be really helpful for demonstrating in a small area how
something actually works. Where books may require pages of explaining, you can
fit a whole lot of action into a 300x80px GIF.

This post should be sprinkled with GIFS. But it’s not, sorry. This is kind of
meta, so I’ll put most of it into a video.


== Shortcomings

- no audio
- repeat is annoying
- when many sprinkled around can bog down a page and also cause distraction
- file sizes get big unless short and small

== Alternatives

- capture a real video
- ascii.io
- asiinema
- script
