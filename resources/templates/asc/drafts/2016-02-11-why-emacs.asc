"Evil mode? What's that?" says a colleague as he glances at my screen.

"Oh, it's a vi emulator for emacs. I just wanted to, uh, see what's on the other side."

Well, here's an explanation of what really behind my thinking about switching over to the dark side.

=== Better Multi-Font Support

=== Org & Outline Mode

=== Better REPL integration

=== More of Clojure community is into Emacs

vs Vim's 15%. That alone doesn't necessarily warrant a switch, but it does mean that much more effort is going into refining the Emacs tools.

=== Encourages keeping a journal

=== Emacs is a workflow
Start out in my journal, pull up a blog entry, edit a presentation, hack some Clojure, remote-connect to a server.

=== Some Emacsen have en eschewed the shell
As much as I love Zsh, I'd be okay with letting it go if my editor could do all it does.

=== Elisp is a lisp, and that's beautiful

=== Asciidoc looks amazing!

=== Presentations

=== Dired

=== Better linting and spell checking
Support for `couldn't`.

=== Magit

=== Modes
Look at markdown as example.

=== StackOverflow (sx) mode

=== Configure a DSL for others

There have been times that I've written a very simple DSL that is
custom colored to show different parts.  With vim, it wasn't possible
to tell an content person to just install vim and my plugin.  With
emacs, it is possible thanks to it's short learning curve to do simple
editing.
