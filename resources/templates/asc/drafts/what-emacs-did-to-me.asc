It's been a couple months now since I've transitioned from Vim to
Emacs. The _Why_ of it is discussed [here].

The change has had a ripple effect on my workflow and physical setup.

== Using Delete and Enter

Back in the Vim/URxvt days, I used to be able to rely on `Ctrl-H` for
all my backspacing needs.

== Ctrl and Meta on Both Sides

== New Keyboard

Meta needed to be really comfortable.

== New Desk!

Now that I hate my laptop keyboard, I needed to make room for the
new one.  This meant

Keyboard tray.

Laptop tray.

== Importance of Double-Spaced Sentences


== Thinking Differently About Modifiers

Now everything is a modifier.

== Fonts Importance

Now that I can have a variety of font sizes and proportionals, I
really enjoy using them.

There are not many fonts that support bold, italic, mono and
proportional at multiple sizes.

 have found _DejaVu Sans Mono_ to be the best free/open font.
