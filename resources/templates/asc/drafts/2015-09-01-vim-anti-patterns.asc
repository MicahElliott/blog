Vim is such a rich editor. So rich that there are many ways to do things. And
many ways some wrong ways, or at least inefficient ways.

== Not understanding transactional editing

== Arrow Keys

== Default QWERTY keyboards

You may have heard some history about the QWERTY layout being suboptimal, but
even worse than its layout is the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_keyboard[IBM PC Model-M Keyboard Standard]
from 1986 we all got forced. Many programmers were lucky enough back then to use
UNIX keyboards that had sensible Ctrl, Esc, and others. But today we all use
laptops with horrible layouts. There are a few egregious issues with the

== Enter key
You may kill you wrist. Look how it pivots to reach your pinky. `Enter` is in a
terrible position.

== Surrounding things manually

    Bi"<esc>ea"

That’s 7 keystrokes, 10 if you count the `Shift`s. What a pain. With the

== x
Too easy to make a habit out of `xxx`.

== Excessive hjkl

== Leaving the window in INSERT mode

== Staying in insert mode
Need to Esc in order to save transaction.

== Ignoring bold, italic, and 256 colors

== Repeating

=== A Better Way
Use `Ctrl-J`.

== Using the mouse

== Not using built-in help

== Not leveraging the powerful “repeat”

== Adopting a distribution you don’t understand

== Relying too much on visual mode

== Save, Change window, refresh browser/suite, back to window, edit

Use write hooks.
