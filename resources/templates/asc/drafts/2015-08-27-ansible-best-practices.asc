Ansible lets you set things up somewhat flexibly.

== Create a multi-purpose ssh config file

== Editor shortcuts

== Zsh helpers

== Special files
In the top of your Ansible project, keep the following files:

    hosts
    site.yaml
    ssh-inventory.config
    ansible.config

Rather than spread files around your machine (`~/.ssh/config`, `/etc/hosts`,
etc), set your own `hosts` file:

    export ANSIBLE_HOSTS=/root/of/your/proj

== Vim helpers

    # Edit ansible with key files open
    alias vi-ans='v -o hosts site.yaml group_vars/all.yaml ssh-inventory.config ansible.cfg'

    # Let zsh auto-complete all membean servers; ssh mnemonic: “ssh membean”
    alias ssm=”ssh -F ${ANSIBLE_HOSTS:h}/ssh-inventory.config”

== Recipes

Simplest test to reach all servers

    ansible bases -m command -a date -u dummy -b -v

Create an app server

    ansible-playbook --skip-tags=slow,skip,nondocker -l appsvrs site.yaml -b
    SSH password: root

    ansible-playbook --skip-tags=skip -l bases site.yaml -v -u dummy -b --ask-become-pass

Update all systems:

Always have a `main.yaml` that is a bunch of `include`s. This way, you can add a
`cur` tag to any other sub-`yaml`.

Sprinkle tags liberally. You might have a single type of change that applies to
several roles, like updating a set of crontabs across servers. Add a `cron` tag
for this.
