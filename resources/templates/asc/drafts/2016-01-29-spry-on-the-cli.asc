If you have to choose between power and speed and it often turns out you have to
make that choice, you’ve got to go for speed.
~ Sparky Anderson

Speed is a great asset; but it’s greater when it’s combined with quickness - and
there’s a big difference.
~ Ty Cobb

What good is speed if the brain has oozed out on the way?
~ Karl Kraus.

Most of us can get by on the command line with a set of commands that we use
daily. But I believe that being highly adept with a set of key commands is super
important for a http:///posts/the-outage-log[critical down situation]. When you
risk dropping a 9 from your uptime, you’re fighting for every second.

This is why I deploy Zsh onto all my servers with a pretty comfortable custom
setup, including lots of aliases, clear prompts, and things that speed me up.
